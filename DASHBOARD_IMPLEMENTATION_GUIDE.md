## 🔄 How It Works

### Registration Flow
1. User signs up on `/auth` page
2. Selects their role from dropdown
3. Account is created with the selected role
4. Role is stored in `user_roles` table

### Login Flow
1. User logs in with email/password
2. AuthContext fetches user role from database
3. User is redirected to `/dashboard`

### Dashboard Routing
1. Dashboard component checks user's role
2. Routes to appropriate role-specific dashboard:
   - `super_admin` → SuperAdminDashboard
   - `admin` → AdminDashboard
   - `doctor` → DoctorDashboard
   - `patient` → PatientDashboard
   - `nurse` → NurseDashboard
   - `receptionist` → ReceptionistDashboard
